    """Initialize a MidiPerformanceEncoder object.

    Encodes MIDI using a performance event encoding. Index 0 is unused as it is
    reserved for padding. Index 1 is unused unless `add_eos` is True, in which
    case it is appended to all encoded performances.

    If `ngrams` is specified, vocabulary is augmented with a set of n-grams over
    the original performance event vocabulary. When encoding, these n-grams will
    be replaced with new event indices. When decoding, the new indices will be
    expanded back into the original n-grams.

    No actual encoder interface is defined in Tensor2Tensor, but this class
    contains the same functions as TextEncoder, ImageEncoder, and AudioEncoder.

    Args:
      steps_per_second: Number of steps per second at which to quantize. Also
          used to determine number of time shift events (up to one second).
      num_velocity_bins: Number of quantized velocity bins to use.
      min_pitch: Minimum MIDI pitch to encode.
      max_pitch: Maximum MIDI pitch to encode (inclusive).
      add_eos: Whether or not to add an EOS event to the end of encoded
          performances.
      ngrams: Optional list of performance event n-grams (tuples) to be
          represented by new indices. N-grams must have length at least 2 and
          should be pre-offset by the number of reserved IDs.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If any n-gram has length less than 2, or contains one of the
          reserved IDs.
